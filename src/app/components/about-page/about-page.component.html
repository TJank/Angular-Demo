        <h2>Welcome to our Demo Website Application</h2>
        <p>
            This website is for demo purposes only! No real data is used and feel free to make up your own data!
            We store none of your data for long periods of time and all changes are hosted independient of other sessions!
        </p>

        <p>
            What does this mean?
            Our team wanted to create an application that was working, secure, and able to display our skills.
            So we created a fully fuctioning scheduler application with different user roles. Some data is static while other is generated in real time.
            Any user data (that you create) is only stored for your session and as soon as you logout or send a new request, all data is cleared!
            Our team's main purpose is to have a place to safely display our skills!
